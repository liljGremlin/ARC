              <a class="aboutText">Founded in 2017, we are a team focused on building both controlled and autonomous
                 drones to compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition. The primary purpose of the IARC
                  is to move the state-of-the-art in aerial robotics forward through the creation of significant and 
                  useful mission challenges that are considered 'impossible' at the time that they are proposed. Through 
                  competing in these competitions students gain real life experience for future success in industry.</a>

                designing and building the frame and aerodynamics of the drone. They also work closely together with the 
                electrical team when mounting of the sensor to the drone.</a>

                in any of the past IARC missions. Teams must create drones which can navigate fully autonomously, identify a target on a 
                moving platform, manipulate objects mid flight, read text in russian, and speed through a 4 mile distance all in 9 minutes.
